OOPTIMO Job Application tests â€” PHP
------------

Solution for Test 1:

- I installed GuzzleHttp for make API calls

- I created a service for using Guzzle here:

services\PostService.php

- I instantiated the PostService class in actionTest1 method of SiteController controller to get post data and passed to the view here:

views\site\test1.php

- I iterated the post array with basic HTML structure and added some styles


INSTALLATION

```shell
composer install
